# Cache Simulator in C

This project implements a simplified **cache memory simulator** in C, designed to simulate cache hit/miss/eviction behavior based on a Valgrind memory trace. It was developed as a hands-on learning tool for exploring cache architecture and memory access behavior.

### 🎯 Objective

The goal was to strengthen understanding of how caches work by:

* Implementing a customizable simulator for different cache configurations (e.g., direct-mapped, set-associative).
* Tracking hits, misses, and evictions based on the **LRU (Least Recently Used)** replacement policy.
* Comparing the simulator output against a reference solution to ensure correctness.

---

### ⚙️ Tools & Technologies

* **Language:** C
* **Toolchain:** GNU (GCC, Make)
* **Platform:** Linux (terminal-based development and testing)

---

### 🛠️ Features & Functionality

* Parses Valgrind memory trace files to simulate real-world memory access patterns.
* Configurable cache architecture with parameters:

  * `s` – number of set index bits
  * `E` – number of lines per set (associativity)
  * `b` – number of block offset bits
* Implements:

  * Accurate **hit/miss/eviction counting**
  * Full **LRU policy support** for replacement logic
* Outputs a summary of simulation results

---

### ✅ Example Core Functions

* `initCache()` – Dynamically allocates the cache
* `accessData()` – Handles each memory operation
* `freeCache()` – Deallocates cache memory
* `printSummary()` – Displays total hits, misses, evictions

---

### 📈 Results

* Validated across all provided memory traces
* Matched output exactly with the reference simulator
* Achieved full marks in evaluation (48/48)

---

### 🧠 Key Learning

This project reinforced understanding of:

* Memory hierarchy and cache access timing
* The role of cache replacement strategies like LRU
* Simulation-driven validation of computer architecture designs
